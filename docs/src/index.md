*"Walks like Python, Runs like C" for open source RF/Microwave engineering*

## Main Features
Marconi.jl is a library for analysis and plotting of linear RF/Microwave networks.
It aims to give similar functionality as the wonderful [scikit-rf](https://scikit-rf-web.readthedocs.io/)
library in pure Julia. While focusing on linear network analysis now, we hope to implement some non-linear analysis
as well as instrument control in the future.

# Coming Soon
Depending on the progress of some other libraries, Marconi.jl would like to include
in the near future
* Calibration
* Instrument control
* Noise analysis
* Filter builders
* Simple network construction from ideal components
* Optimization of said networks
* Advanced calibration routines
* Non-linear analysis (X-Parameters, Load Pull, etc.)
* More interactivity with plots

# Using Marconi.jl
To use Marconi.jl simply use the Pkg REPL
```julia
] add Marconi
```
or from Pkg itself
```julia
using(Pkg)
Pkg.add("Marconi")
```
